== PROJECT: FlashCards

---

== Overview
FlashCards is a desktop flashcard consolidation application for students to compile and organise notes for different subjects.
It provides an easy way to have a simple way to store and categorise notes digitally. Additionaly users can also conduct self quizzing when needed. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

We decided to morph the base code provided, AddressBook4, to create this useful and meaning application for students.

I was in charge of developing the toggle features and quizzing format as explained below. 
== Summary of contributions

The following are the my contributions and their purpose in the application:

* *Major enhancement*: added *Toggle feature*
** What it does: It allows the user to navigate between flashcard easily with a next and previous command.
** Justification: This feature improves the navigation process for viewing the flashcard. Instead of always selecting a flashcard by index, users can just command next or previous to toggle through the flashbook.
** Highlights:  This enhancement is designed to work with existing commands as well as other commands that will be added in the future. It incorporates algorithms and operating styles thought in this module.

* *Major enhancement*: added *Sort feature*
** What it does: It allows the user to view all flashcards based off their desired difficulty.
** Justification: This feature provides a filtered flashbook for users to focus on only reading flashcards with selected difficulty. This commands also allow users to search for flashcards of that difficulty.
** Highlights:  This enhancement is designed to work with existing commands as well as other commands that will be added in the future. It focuses mainly on the logic and model segment of the code to produce the desired outcome. I had to use various Java built-in libraries to achieve this.
** Credits: This code was inspired by the find command that was provided in address book 4. I adapted from `TopicContainsKeywordPredicate` class, made changes to it to achieve the desired outcome.


* *Minor enhancement*: Added a status bar for total number of flashcards that the flashbook contains.
* *Minor enhancement*: Added an Events Center for tracking any addition to the code.
* *Minor enhancement*: Added a `selectSubject` command to allow users to choose the subject.
