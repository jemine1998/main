== PROJECT: FlashCards

---

== Overview

This portfolio is written to document the process of developing FlashCards throughout the course of one semester in a team of 3 members.
My team chose to morph the basic Address Book into FlashCards and my role was to design and write the code for the *deadline* features as well as the *GUI display* of the flashcards.

FlashCards is a desktop flash book application written in Java which targets mainly secondary school students.
It is specially designed to cater to users a platform to digitize and store their notes in one place.
The user interacts with the application using a Command Line Interface (CLI) and it has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX.

The following sections illustrate these enhancements in more details, as well as the relevant sections I have added to the user and developer guides in relation to these enhancements.

== Summary of contributions
This sections summarises my coding, documentation and other relevant contributions to the team project.

* *Major enhancement 1*: added *the ability to add deadlines to flashcards* (Pull requests https://github.com/cs2113-ay1819s2-m11-3/main/pull/12[#12], https://github.com/cs2113-ay1819s2-m11-3/main/pull/13[#13], https://github.com/cs2113-ay1819s2-m11-3/main/pull/14[#14], https://github.com/cs2113-ay1819s2-m11-3/main/pull/107[#107]) 
** What it does: The *deadline* command allows the user to add deadline or notes to a specified flashcard.
** Justification: Initially, my team decided on implementing an internal Calendar which will count the number of days left before the deadline and display it below the deadline. However, we decided that it will be more versatile if the user can input his notes in. For example, Clarify with the Teacher. This feature improves the product significantly as it serves as a reminder to the user about the upcoming deadlines or the notes attached. 
** Highlights: This enhancement does not affect existing commands and commands to be added in future. It is an independent command and it can only be added after the selected flashcards exist in the FlashBook. This gives the user the choice to decide if he/she wants to assign a deadline or a note to the flashcard.
Also, if the user wants to update the existing deadline, he can enter the command again with a different date and this new date will override the existing date. Implementation of the command was simple and straightforward.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added tests for *deadline* command. Add *Note* alias (Pull Request https://github.com/cs2113-ay1819s2-m11-3/main/pull/107[#107])
* *Code contributed*: [https://nuscs2113-ay1819s2.github.io/dashboard-beta/#search=dann&sort=displayName&since=2019-02-10&until=2019-04-01&timeframe=day&reverse=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabAuthor=dannong&tabRepo=CS2113-AY1819S2-M11-3_main_master&repoSort=true[Functional code]]
 
* *Major enhancement 2*: added *GUI display of topic and content* (Pull request https://github.com/cs2113-ay1819s2-m11-3/main/pull/80[#80], https://github.com/cs2113-ay1819s2-m11-3/main/pull/102[#102], https://github.com/cs2113-ay1819s2-m11-3/main/pull/107[#107])
** What it does: The *GUI display* allows the user to alternate between the topic and the content of the flashcard.
** Justification: The physical copy of a flashcard has two sides, and to simulate that in the application, I added two buttons for *topic* and *content* respectively. This allows the user to switch between topic and content easily.
** Highlights: -

* *Minor enhancement*: Changed the background of GUI display to black for the text to stand out. Add mnemonicParsing for the buttons. (Pull request https://github.com/cs2113-ay1819s2-m11-3/main/pull/86[#86])
* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com/cs2113-ay1819s2-m11-3/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/RightPanel.java[Functional code in Java]] [https://github.com/cs2113-ay1819s2-m11-3/main/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/RightPanel.fxml[Functional code in FXML]]
